# QueryAugur
Query Augur is a person-finding database that can be accessed by the public and public service workers.  With the ability to search individuals up by a multitude of different parameters Query Augur aims to provide critical information about people to people. End users will be able to search for anybody they want. For example the ability to search your senator by name to see past infringements. Query Augur aims to make the most out of the information age and allow regular people to be able to see peopleâ€™s records they might want to have hidden.

Work in progress. Currently i are in the process of building Query Augur as I learn the languages associated with this project.
